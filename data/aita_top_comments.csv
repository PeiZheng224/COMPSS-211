First rule of tattoos: your body, your canvas, sounds like he's not respecting your boundaries. I would be super weirded out if my partner pressured me to tattoo their name on, even after I made my refusal clear. This is *not* something you're expected to do when you get married and very few people ever do it or expect it. Everyone I've ever met who liked tattoos always backed off and respected your wishes if you told them you weren't interested in getting one.

This is a pretty common kink in the BDSM community as a way to show ownership and degrade the person in question and reduce them into your property (though if he got a tattoo of your name, it might not entirely be this connotation).

Except obviously you are transphobic. Not because you wont date her, but because you insist on calling her a man and saying you cant date her because you're not gay (she isnt a man so that wouldnt be a homosexual relationship.)

This is coming from an adoptee. It was a family adoption, and no switching countries or cultures. I was already four. My adoptive mother wanted to change my name, but my adoptive father talked her out of it with my sense of identity in mind. He thought it would be hard enough on me to change everything in my life, without adding the name change. 

Even with that, as an adoptee there is a lot of feeling of “otherness”. I didn’t look like my adoptive parents, or my cousins, although we were the same race. 

I guess what I am trying to say is that there will be enough “otherness” for an adoptee of a different race, without giving him/her an exotic name. At the end of the day it is up to the parents, of course. But you are definitely not wrong in your thinking.

Holy cow. I can't believe anyone is defending this OP's actions. Good lord!

It really bothers me how much you harp on about paying for the apartment. This is the definition of someone ""being generous""...but with strings attached. Like, either you pay for the apartment and you're okay with it, or you guys should split costs so there isn't an unequal power balance.

In what world is it okay to feel as though you have additional power over what your SO does with her personal money just because you pay rent? Like, if you feel she owes you money for rent, ask her for rent. If she doesn't owe you money for rent, *it's her fucking money*. 

It's really messed up to think that you have an additional claim to the house because you pay for it...I'm pretty sure you didn't mention that to her when you guys made this arrangement. Like, ""yeah, no worries, I make more money so I'll pay the rent, no problem. But also, I get rights of approval over how you spend the money I'm saving you, and if we ever fight or break up, I'll kick you out immediately with no recourse and you'll be homeless, you're okay with that, right?"" No one would actually sign up for that kind of power imbalance if they knew that's how you thought about it.

OP, the way you address the control of the finances and your *ownership* of the house really strikes me as unhealthy and controlling. I would normally think that the girlfriend is bonkers for springing this trip on you, but with your reaction, I can kind of see why she felt the need to. Like, yes -- a surprise vacation like that is a big deal that she didn't mention. And if you want to break up with her over it, that's fine. This doesn't sound like the most healthy of relationships, anyway.

But kicking her out on her ass? Not only is that probably illegal, but it's a total dick move.

Break up with her, but tell her she'll have to look for a new place when she gets back. She's got 30 days. That's all you had to do.

That poor girl. 

>  I tried to calm her down and explain that she can't have any of it because of her health but you can't really reason with her.

Of course not. Because she's a child. She wants what she sees her stepsisters having. That's totally normal. I'm shocked you and your wife were naive enough to think you could hide that from her. You should have at least prepared her for the situation, but you tried to be sneaky.  That's just awful. 

The bare minimum you could have done would be to let her know her stepsisters were getting candy and to give her an alternative. But you didn't give her anything at all, did you?

Your STBX wants to ensure the financial futures of your children.  That's understandable.

However, it would be reasonable for you to place limits on your financial support.  Instead of saying ""No"", consider countering with paying 1/3 of tuition, room and board, costs not covered by scholarships, not to exceed the cost of in-state public college costs.  That would limit your costs to about $10k per year at current prices.  Also, put in that it's for up to 4 years per kid, the child needs to be attending full-time, and that you no longer need to pay if their GPA drops below 2.5.

I say split the difference. Get the cheaper apartment and pay equal percentages of income. If you owe $1800 together and she pays $300 while you pay $1500, you each only spend 15% of your take home.  You can still pay at least $7000 toward your loans while still giving yourself a similar allowance to live on, but you leave her with the ability to pitch in more, too.

ESH(among the adults).

Your wife above just undermined you as a parent in-front of your daughter. This is the kiss of death in parenting as your daughter now knows how to get around any decision you make that she doesn't like in the future. You and your wife need to get on the same page.

However

This sounds like at absolute over-reaction and *childish* on your part.

This should have spawned a calm conversation in private between you and your wife, instead it lead to you emotionally reacting, your wife emotionally reacting and your kid being caught in the middle.

I am gonna go out on a limb here and say you and your wife need to work on supporting each other as parents.

I don't know how many times it has to be said. 

THERE IS NOTHING SEXUAL OR INAPPROPRIATE ABOUT BREAST FEEDING. 

That's literally what breasts are for. Would you have been upset with her feeding her baby from a bottle at the table? If not then it was clearly an appropriate place to feed a baby. 

Sounds like this was a golden opportunity to be a good role model for those younger kids and show them that breast feeding is normal, natural, and not something anyone needs to freak out about. 

Instead you decided to be a puritanical a-hole about it and embarrass her in front of everyone because you can't help but sexualize her body while she's feeding her baby. 

Teens may be a bit tactless and stare if they've never seen something like that before, although I really hope they were introduced to breasts and breast feeding in health class by this point, but it's definitely not something that's unhealthy for them to see and if she didn't want them to look then SHE could have made the choice to move elswhere.

This may be the first time he has specifically called his parents and actually said stop doing this thing, but it is not the first time in 12 years that we have tried to correct them on our names. In the past, it has mostly come from me, and it would usually be me reminding FIL what our oldest son's last name is after he would introduce him to people incorrectly. (Our oldest is 11). Or in regards to what my name actually is when being spoken of. 

We should have been firmer over the years, but the drama that has unfolded because we finally straight up asked them to include all our names has been ridiculous. Our friends and the relatives on my side of the family have no issue with using our names correctly. And we have discussed both changing our names to the hyphenated version as absolute proof of our dedication to both names, just haven't taken that step yet because I also feel a little like that would be giving in. 

Edit: Since many have asked for my ""personal reasons"" for keeping my name:

Long story. My mom and dad were never married, and when I was born, my mom gave me her name. Well, when I was 4 years old, she ended up taking my dad to court for child support, and as part of the proceedings, the judge gave me the option to choose which last name I wanted. Being a small naive child, I was enamored with my dad, having just met him for the first time and wanting to impress him and feel close to him. I chose to have his name, and so my name was legally changed to his. After a few years of visitations, when I was 7 my dad decided he didn't want to see me anymore and cut off all contact with me. No more visitations, no more phone calls, nothing. His parents even returned holiday cards that I mailed to them. I realized I had made a terrible mistake in changing my name to his, because he wasn't my family, my mom and my aunts and uncles who cared for me, helped raise me, and took an interest in my life, were my family. I wanted to change my name back, but we would have had to get permission from my dad, who wouldn't give it, or take him to court again, and we couldn't afford that. 

On my 18th birthday, my mom took me out of school for the day and we went down to the courthouse, and I stood before a judge and said my reasons for changing it and had my name changed back to her name. It was a very emotional and powerful experience to reclaim that part of myself, after being abandoned by my dad and his family. I knew then that no matter what, I would never give my name away again. 

When we were dating, I made sure my now-husband knew all of that and was ok with it. I wouldn't have married someone who wasn't ok with me keeping my name. And he knew that I wanted my children to share my name, too. There are no male relatives from my generation with my name to pass it in the traditional way, so I wanted my kids to have it. We have never had a problem between us about our name choices. I've told my in-laws this story before, and even discussed it very recently with MIL because my dad actually passed away unexpectedly in April and a lot of stuff has come up because of that. So it is common knowledge, or should be. And they just don't care. And are perhaps even offended by it.",467.0,AmItheAsshole,,995.0

This is not because your marriage is in trouble—yet—but because this fundamental disagreement _will_ lead to problems in the future. Just imagine what the stress of raising children will do when thrown in the mix. Get it sorted out before it becomes a big issue. Trust me.",466.0,AmItheAsshole,,582.0

I just can’t be that nice.

You know what else has been “cultural tradition”?

Holding slaves. Having incest. Torture. Forcing young girls into arranged marriages. FGM. Burning a woman because her husband died. I could continue but I believe I’ve made my point.

I’m someone who thought it wasn’t possible to get “too PC”. I was wrong. 

This is basically blackmail, and buying/selling another human being. And everyone is so worried to say it’s wrong, because they don’t want to be called out for being disrespectful.

Call me out, I do not care! Because once you take away someone’s autonomy to use for selfish gain, control, or punishment  (which these parents absolutely did by demanding 120 THOUSAND dollars) you are in the wrong. Period. 

I have to put some weight on daughter and OP for sharing enough financial info, and humoring the parents to this point, where they even felt like they could ask for such a huge sum. 

However, I can at least understand a well-meaning young girl trying to please her parents, and feeling like she has to make sure, they have some money to fall back on, and that her marriage to a foreigner doesn’t “screw” her parents. (Thinking of others).

I can also understand a man, madly in love with some girl, and being willing to do anything he can to have a life with her, including being respectful and compliant of local traditions. While I don’t think it’s right to ask OP for money, if the plan is already set to pay for his parents through their old age, I can understand why OP would initially give in. (Thinking of others, again).

The parents? Fuck. No. Thinking of themselves!

They are trying to USE their daughter to squeeze every penny possible out of OP. Thank God she found her own husband; she’d likely have been sold to the highest bidder otherwise.

They are going above and beyond a normal dowry (which is already bad enough) and are total scammers. I feel bad for OP, and I feel bad for daughter!

OP was very generous to be willing to pay an “average” dowry. This generosity is being taken for granted. There are only 2 options, IMO, unless OP is willing to waffle over.

Option 1: Offer an average dowry. Tell them you know this is average, you want to give their daughter a good life, and this is what you can afford. Take it or leave it.

Option 2: You tried to play nice. They tried to take advantage of you and got greedy. Therefore, they get nothing, and you get married anyway. 

*shrug* But in the end it’s OP’s life. Those are the only ways I see of handling it, but he’s the one in the pickle. So I suppose he could always choose to give them the full sum. But I don’t recommend it. I feel like that would be setting up a lifetime of giving in the in-laws “because tradition”.",464.0,AmItheAsshole,,1977.0

holy fuck, why would you send him to a woman that insists he eats food that is harmful to him? Who gets to decide how harmful is harmful? Apparently your shitty mom, according to her!

Get a sitter. Getting one vetted through a friend or some site is worth the extra money, if you lay out guidelines for what your son is able to eat, and they follow it. Look into afterschool programs if you have that option. Your mother is a total fucking narcissist if she thinks she can have control over him like that.

I have 2 autistic kids. When they were little, they had issues with food. It wasn't even fucking allergies, yet I took that shit seriously, and made 2 or sometimes 3 separate meals at at time, because I cooked for my then husband also. I didn't bitch about it, it was something I did, because you DON'T FUCK WITH CHILDREN AND FOOD.

NEVER APOLOGIZE. Tell your mom that until she apologizes for trying to force son to eat things that make him ill, she can pound sand. No pediatrician or child therapist or specialist would EVER advise feeding children allergens just because they only get 'a LITTLE sick'

If she can't even bother to make him a sandwich or a salad at least, she can go fuck off, there are lots of foods that while they don't actually qualify as meals, can keep him filled until you can go get him. She's fucking awful. 

I bet if you end up in therapy and examine your past with her, it will come up as her being controlling, abusive and sociopathic, and not just 'strict'.

Good on you for encouraging your son to enforce his boundaries.

Allergies change over time, sometimes at random. I became allergic to shellfish OUT OF NOWHERE. One night I was eating and my fucking throat started closing up, didn't know why, but it was terrifying. There were no shrimp in the food I was eating.

What you learn in a formal martial arts class isn’t what you’d learn in a good self-defense class for women.   

Learning to punch correctly might be enough for your average guy to defend themselves against another average guy.   But 95% of females are going to be so severely outmassed and outreached that skill and training won’t make up for it.   We have to fight dirty - ball-kicking, eye gouging etc.   Formal martial arts train you NOT to do those things.

Back in the day, I was pretty serious about training.  I could win medals competing.  But it was against females, in my weight division, who were also following the artificial rules of the tournament.    My male friends could pin me using just a fraction of their strength.

If you're right about possibly being excluded from awards, I can see why you'd be reluctant, but you should find out if that's actually true before reacting to it - I would be surprised if it is, because festivals like this are usually held to promote inclusion, and doing as you describe would be antithetical to that.

Also, seriously, you're a filmmaker with an opportunity to get your film before a bunch of people who might otherwise not see it, and you don't want to do it? I'm no filmmaker, but that just seems utterly illogical to me.

At the very least, sit down with your colleagues and tell them how you feel, because they at the very least deserve to know your reasons.

&#x200B;

The fact is that even professional people get pushed to their limits.  We'd need more info to determine if the manager is the asshole or if it was the fault of the girl.

&#x200B;

As a manager of someone who cried--just fuuuuuuck.  She was a shit employee who literally did boarderline illegal things.  She KNEW what she was doing was wrong and she'd start the waterworks on the floor.  I'd try to call her into the back and she'd start full-on panic attack mode.  At one point we were so concerned we nearly called an ambulance.  She dodged so many write ups.    When we talked in the back room or after work?  Pathologically calm and lied through her teeth.   Constantly played managers and employees against each other, like my manager would come to me with this totally crazy story so then we began to require both of us to do write ups.  Blamed our special needs employees for things they couldn't have done.  (like legit, one had down syndrome and was barley 4 feet tall.  She accused him of putting something on a shelf that was over 6 feet up.  Not even possible)  My head manager got fed up with it.  It was slow, Karen just did something that was unethical.  My manager told me to put a sign on the door that said we'd be back open in 10 minutes and I shooed the one other customer out.    

&#x200B;

Karen's tears?  gone.  She said some defiant shit but we resolved and she signed her ""final"" write up with dry eyes.   We reopened immediately and the very next person she helped she burst into tears and said she was having a terrible day and gestured to me.  I told her please go clock out for the day, immediately, and I would finish helping the customer.    She sobbed so hard to the back room I was sure she was going to pass out.  She was taken off the schedule and we told her that if she could show evidence that she was working to resolve her issues she could come back.  She never did.

Babies/toddlers show an innate preference of people who look like their caregivers and a lower level of trust of those who don't. It's theorised that was evolved purely because their family, (who, in most circumstances, would be the same race as them), are more likely to offer them care. Whether that actually counts as racism, not being an acquired prejudice based on stereotyping, is debatable though. 



EDIT: So I'm going to clarify a few things: 


1. I'm not saying this excuses racism or this is the reason racism exists.


2. I'm not saying that the kid in OP's story acted the way he did because of this. At 9 you're well past the age where this is a thing.


3. I'm not saying that kids will always eschew people of other races because of this, this is something that appears in infants/toddlers and (I think) decreases as their brains develop. Environment is what's important in forming a child's mind.


4. I'm not saying that babies will ALWAYS avoid ALL people of other races they see. I think the preference is only shown when they are presented two strangers; one who is the same race, one who is another race. 


5. I don't personally consider this innate preference to be evidence of 'racism' in babies. I was just making a fairly fatuous point based on a study I thought was interesting.",458.0,AmItheAsshole,,434.0

Why the silent treatment? And why can't he look? Unless he's rummaging around back there you seem to have everything visible so it's on you if someone looks.

If your company has a no weapons on site policy and the place you park your car is a company owned building then you should not be storing guns in your car while it is parked there. I don't know the policy so can't really judge there.

Your co workers were probably concerned someone they work with had so many weapons in the car when they don't understand why you'd need so many weapon, and you made no effort to explain and just got angry instead. You yourself say it's not a gun friendly area.

Also, why the fuck do you need that many weapons in your car? A gun or two I could understand but you mentioned there's **more** weapons than the 3 guns you mentioned.

You wanted to reach her socially, and you found a way to do it. Your motivation was good, and the method you used isn't hurting anybody, so you're not an asshole. It's that simple.

There's plenty of people that would handle this differently, but not everyone is built the same - so that's not a defect on your part.

One point that I agree with some of the heavily-downvoted folks in this thread on (the downvote button is for people who don't contribute to the discussion, it's not a disagree button you assholes) is that how **you** treat others is a reflection on who *you* are as a person - regardless of what they've done.  What **they** have done is a reflection of who *they* are.

For your own sake, take a moment to ponder what things would be like if she ends up dying from this cancer 6 months from now.  Are **you** going to be satisfied living the rest of your life with the decisions that *you* have made?  Because once she has died, there's no going back, apologizing and making up for it.  You don't want to be left thinking less of yourself in hindsight for decades for your actions in a time of great pain for yourself.

Let me be very clear: I am not suggesting in any way that I think anything that you have done is the wrong thing.  I'm just recognizing that so much of what's involved here is subjective and based on emotions - what you can live with (and what she can live with) isn't something someone else can tell you, or judge you for.  And it may be the opposite thing that others would do in your place - that doesn't mean they are wrong either, it just means that they are different people.

I see you say that you won't forgive her when it's over.  That isn't something that you owe her, regardless of whatever else has/is happening to her.  If I can be so bold as to suggest it, I'd like to remind you that [forgiveness is done for the benefit of the forgiver, not the forgiven](https://animityhealth.com/2017/03/24/forgiveness-its-something-we-do-for-ourselves-not-others/).

In fact, before it started, I took all the older kids aside and told them to remember we had little friends and it would make them sad if the big kids found all the eggs. Since most kids tend to be pretty compassionate, they of course didn’t want to make their little friends sad. So when I saw them start to get over excited and steam roll over the younger ones, I just to say “Timmy, remember what we talked about” and they would back off. A lot of them even took the smaller kids by the hand and showed them where to find the egg they were about to grab.

**It'd be very easy to see why the brother is saying "" he loves the baby and it's his"" -- he's denying there's even the** ***chance*** **it may not be his, which is foolish.  What do you think would happen if, say, years down the road, he finds out it's not his?**  A whole family may get torn apart, a family that would have had the baby's entire infancy and life time to re-adjust and give the girlfriend an opportunity to make a family with the real father.  Even if they found out later the baby isn't his and still stayed together, the fact is that the brother isn't acknowledging the possibility it may not be his and choosing to raise it anyway, he's denying a realistic possibility -- and that's a recipe for a huge blowup down the road.  **The type of person who is in denial about an issue is, by definition, a person who cannot handle that ugly truth they're denying.

Everyone mourns differently, and your girlfriend has the right to cherish the moments she had with this man. Whether it be tattooing her skin, or posting about her loss on social media. 

And even after breaking up with someone, you can still love them as a person, wish the best for them, and cherish the moments you’ve had with them. It’s not like that meaningful relationship and all of it’s memories just disappear as you move on to your next chapter with someone.

The only reason you’re upset is because the tattoo is in memory of someone she’s been romantic with. You have to look past that.

Shouldn’t you be communicating about these sorts of financial situations in a relationship? Especially one where you’re living together? As far as my read goes, she’s being financially intelligent/living frugally to improve her future so she isn’t living in debt, as well as understanding that spending money doesn’t make you happy. I am not entirely sure what exactly makes you so annoyed about this. Either you’re annoyed that you blindly made assumptions and now you want to blame her, or you’re salty that you’re not the big, strong, providing breadwinner you thought you were. Either way, get over yourself, she didn’t lie to make you pay for stuff, you went out of your way to throw your own money at her because you didn’t bother to communicate.

Also, I’m pretty sure you don’t need to be “familiar with” the medical field to know most jobs in it pay well, especially if you went to school to do it.

Edit: I completely understand leaving out specific numbers, but it’s also pretty weird to me that you just say “six figures.” If she’s making 900,000 I could understand your complaint. But at minimum, six figures is 100,000 a year and that is quite a chunk of change, yeah, but if she owes $1K in loans a month, and she’s doing 3x that to escape debt, that’s $36K and a big chunk of that 100,000 a year gone. Add in normal living expenses like the 50% of the bills she’s paying and food/gas/etc, why couldn’t she be considered “broke”?

I think it was last week that this weird housing place I live in caught actual fire. Not just the alarms, there was smoke and flames. But it was coming from the fourth floor and I was on the first.

It’s a big enough building where there are alarms that say “Brrrr...FIRE” and I got out. 

And knowing there were first responders there and I should stay out, I still went back and got my cat and knocked on doors to get people out.

This pissed off all the drunk people, who were just chilling in their rooms while this loud alarm was going off. Why? Just evacuate just in case, jeez. And I got my cat in an imperfect carrier, and then she scratched me to heck, and it was a mess.

People need to care more about the fire. Seriously.

Edit to add that this building is concrete, so there ended up being no danger by the time it got to my floor. And there was a lot of space so I didn’t actually get in the way.

Don’t give in. Make the meal that you and your husband are going to eat. Offer it to your son. If he gets picky about it, then he doesn’t eat.  After the meal, the kitchen is closed. No more food, no snacks, nothing. 

In my personal experience, kids are picky because parents let them be. They make them a special meal, they let them snack, etc. why would a kid eat vegetables, when they know they will get graham crackers an hour later if they refuse to eat?

Another thing you can do, is save their leftovers. If they refuse to eat, then calmly tell them “this is our meal. You can choose to eat it now, or we can save it and you can have it at the next meal”. If they have a tantrum or a fit, you let them do that, but you hold the line. “This is what we are having for dinner. You can eat it, or you can go to bed hungry. What’s best for you?”

Your will is stronger than a child’s. It might sound “mean”, but I can assure you that your son will eat, and this is something that’s a million times easier to solve NOW so that it doesn’t turn into something impossible to manage later.

I have a sense he’s leaving a lot out of this. I went through cancer treatment with about 2 dozen other young women. One or two husbands were very supportive, one or two were okay; the rest were varying degrees of asshole. 

Aside from the sexual, physical and hormonal side effects, and the extreme trauma of cancer, the lack of spousal support through treatment can really strain a relationship. He may think he was a great help during this time; her story may be very different. 

A lot of these guys badgered their wives for sex whilst reminding them that the laundry needed to be done and the kids needed their baths, while they were going through surgery, chemo, radiation, complications. There may be an enormous emotional chasm between them now. 

None of these women can risk a pregnancy now. Yet not one of the men is willing to get a vasectomy. They complain about condoms all the time and expect their wives to go back in for another major operation and get tubes tied, etc. and place the entire burden of sexual functioning and family planning on the wife.

Listen, this is a really fucking hard situation and I really feel for you.  Ultimately its up to you to make the best decision for you and your kids, and I don't think there are any bad decisions to make as you believe you're doing whats best.

So obviously you know this, but it deserves to be said: you husband has a disease.  He's an alcoholic.  That doesn't excuse his actions, but it explains them.  It's an addiction, which is a mental health issue.  Obviously he has some agency and choice here, but the point remains.  Some people can deal with this themselves, some people can't.

With that said: while yes, he's your husband, that doesn't mean you need to sacrifice your and your kids well being to help him. You've spent 10 yeas with him and have been through this before.  You've done more than is morally required of you.  If you have the energy, the ability, and the interest to continue to help him, thats fine.  But if you don't then *that's perfectly acceptable too*.  Youve done and given so much already, it's okay for you to say enough is enough.

Again, this is a fucking hard situation to be in.  And obviously what he is doing is really shitty, but it's hard to say he's morally wrong for not being stronger than his addiction.  Yes, it would be better if he was able to, but I just can't call him in asshole for suffering from this disease.

Now i’m not arguing that cheating isn’t bad. but what makes cheating so awful and traumatic is the betrayal and deception by the person who’s supposed to be your partner, closest friend and confidante.

this is clearly not the case here. they barely even TALK anymore! of course cheating sucks - but OP has already experienced that betrayal and deception when she was tricked into a marriage that her husband seemingly never intended to consummate. to add insult to injury, he then withdrew all affection, intimacy, and seemingly even any kind of friendship or partnership.

“just file for divorce!” - the OP didn’t plan to cheat, according to her. it’s not like she set up a dating profile with the intention of carrying on an affair. she was living in this pseudo-marriage and trying to make it work, and she made a drunken mistake.

i don’t really have a judgment, i suppose, but OP - you deserve better. you deserve a relationship that fulfils you, at the very LEAST emotionally, but ideally in every way. you’re still in your 20s - i know it feels like you have a lot to lose, but you are so young. you have plenty of time to rebuild your life into one that makes you happy. fuck the condo. and your husband deserves the same! you two aren’t right for eachother. that doesn’t mean there’s not someone out there for him - for one, there are tonnes of asexual women out there who could happily be in a loving relationship without sex. it’s just not you, and that’s okay. you both deserve to be happy, and it doesn’t sound like you can be that together.

OP, you love your GF, even if she went a little ballistic. If she doesn't have a history of controlling behavior and this came out of the blue, you probably at least owe it to yourself to get to the bottom of the situation and figure out why it happened the way it did.

The fact that GF immediately sequestered herself and REFUSED to be part of a conversation about whether or not the relationship was worth continuing is a huge red flag for me. Relationships are work and always have been; someone shutting down the second the going gets rough has never been a good sign, for me. It almost always spells the eventual end of a relationship because I refuse to be the only one working my ass off to get through a rough patch, especially if it's not a rough patch caused entirely and solely by me.

I suggest therapy and counseling a lot, and I'm going to do it again because sometimes a third party has insight to the situation that you are too close to see: Go see a couple's therapist.

And that kid probably had real issues from being raised by a drug mom (and no mention of dad) and then abandonment issues, maybe they genuinely tried or maybe he took the shit that he wasn't good enough and not their blood growing up too but in any case he turned out to be an alcoholic, thief and drunk driver. It's a shit stain on the family tree the OP would rather pretend doesn't exist because he's not of the blood.

But from the ""brother's"" perspective this is all the family he's ever had since he was 4yo. I think pretty much any parent that's raised a child from 4yo to adulthood would consider it their child, even if there's a bio-mom/bio-dad somewhere out there.

So don’t you  try to pin it on “your traditional culture” which “allows you to mess around with non Muslim girls”. 

Secondly, your basic question “AITA for only marrying Muslim girls” if that was all that question was then no, because everyone has preferences and wants to have certain criteria met in their significant other. However, this is not the case with you, your question is flawed and so is your logic. I recommend you to figure out what you want in life, be a damn grown man and be honest with that girl.

Disobeying these laws is a pretty serious crime. You're looking at jail time if you own an illegally-acquired firearm, and there's no ""I didn't know officer"" here really.

Now assuming you have all that legal shit in order (which it **really** doesn't sound like you do) I'd still say you really should okay with your roommates that you're going to have a freaking assault rifle in the goddamn house. Assuming you're doing it legally, you do have a right to own a gun, but your roommates also pay rent, and they have the right to feel safe and comfortable in their own house. Given that you didn't okay it with them and likely don't have the proper documentation to legally own a firearm, I'd say **YTA**. Big time.

Might wanna contact the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. Like, asap, **if you're in a state that prohibits firearms and you're illegally owning one.**

~~Edit: Okay so I did some quick research and these states don't require a license/permit to purchase a firearm: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, and Kansas. So unless OP is from one of these states, yeah, I think they have an illegal firearm.~~

Edit2: Okay I've changed my mind. Given OPs lack of understanding of firearm laws, snapping IG pics with her new assault rifle, not knowing whether a gun is ""safe"" because it doesn't have bullets in it, buying the gun from the trunk of a guy in the parking lot at a Tilted Kilt (Irish-themed Hooters), not informing her roommates that she had interest or plans on buying a gun, I'm gonna see YTA for sure. Definitively.

Edit3: I've learned a lot about gun laws from this thread, which is great, and I'll know better in the future, so thanks. But my point still stands, OP doesn't know the local gun laws for her, doesn't seem to respect basic gun safety/responsibility, she touts her new firearm on social media like it's a toy, she randomly surprised her roommates with her new gun. Still an asshole in my book, legal gun or not.

Were we not discovering or sexualities and sexual boundaries online?
Sure, it's important to talk to her about the dangers of grooming. It's important to talk to her about keeping herself safe. It's important to discuss with her the dangers of the online dating world.

It was incredibly bad judgement on her part to not tell you first and I completely understand your POV and hurt feelings about this.

However storming out and getting a hotel room is a pretty extreme reaction and if I was at that dinner party it would be hard not to assume you were pissed that she’s pregnant, so you didn’t make yourself look very good.

Maybe your wife can explain to everyone you were upset because you didn’t get to find out first, and then you can forgive her? You need to get back to a space where you can enjoy this because resentment is good for no one and it’s really not that big a deal in the long scheme of things.

Unpopular opinion: If you're a parent that cuts your kid off before age 20-22 in the modern day, you're setting them behind, probably for life, and are an asshole. Straight up.

Every kid I went to school with that got cut off as soon as they left high school is now a decade or more behind in their careers. They spent the first years of their working lives working dead end jobs just to make ends meet and racking up credit card debt just to pay the bills. Most never got educated. Most were near 30 by the time they got into stable, long-term work. Their careers and personal lives will likely never fully recover from that.

Helping your kid out financially between 18-25 benefits them tremendously, and in more ways than financial. Kids that aren't strapped for cash are able to pursue better job opportunities instead of whatever is tossed to them. They are able to pursue romantic relationships and start a family. I know couples that are facing the prospect of never having kids because they spent most of their 20s and 30s struggling to make ends meet and now that they're almost ready, theyre finding it might be too late.

This is all besides the fact that most kids under 24 or so simply aren't experienced enough to deal with all the complexities of adult life. It isn't that they aren't smart enough, but things like how to act in a job interview, how to file your taxes, etc. are all skills that they don't teach in school and you learn from experience and being guided by involved parents. fucking off to the mountains doesn't help that

My father intimidated us all into shutting up if we had a problem yet constantly overwhelmed us with his nonverbal expressions of dissatisfaction, disgust and anger.  At this point I just look at him as a manipulative coward afraid to use his own voice.

It took me decades to figure out how to be at peace with my own thoughts and feelings and it took me decades to learn how to express them effectively.  For years I either went way overboard or tried to downplay them verbally all the while not being able to hide them on my face.

OP, NTA. Your fiance has lied to you so often, and broken so many promises, that I don't see how you could ever reasonably trust him to keep his word again. If you marry him anyway, do yourself a favor and assume he's cheating on you.

Edit: to get a search warrant, police need to have ""a reasonable amount of suspicion, supported by circumstances sufficiently strong to justify a prudent and cautious person's belief that certain facts are probably true"", i.e. probable cause. That's also the standard in my opinion for when invading your partner's privacy becomes justified.

I made the mistake to yell to my mom how i hated my younger sister when in reality what i hated was the situation she was putting me through.

I remember i yelled that after feeling incredibly frustrated because she had allowed my sister's dad who had molested me back in the house because ""your sister misses him and is not like he's messing with you anymore"" so that night after yet again being scolded for something my little sister had said i yelled i hated her.

That was a horrible thing to do and it is eating you up because you did a wrong thing. At this point, telling him what you did doesn't fix the situation. He still made a decision based on your lie.

I was in your situation with my current husband. He was with a girl who didn't treat him well. I was their friend.  I ended up with a huge crush on him.  He often came to me for advice as a friend.  I spent about a year carefully giving him advice to stay in his relationship and work on better communication skills.  I was the one friend who never said an unkind word about his ex because I wanted him to make his own mind up.   I did that because I believe that it isn't ethical to try to break up a couple to get a new relationship going. I think that a relationship founded on such an act probably won't end well. When they broke up naturally I waited a time... asked him out ... and we have had a happy 10 year relationship.

That said, in my opinion this is your burden to bear now. Telling him is going to fill him with indecision about his prior break up and distrust and pain about your betrayal. If it really was an incident, not a greater indication of your character and suitability as a partner ... him not knowing will spare him pain.  You can be the one to carry it because you did it. I don't believe you are necessarily a crap person or have a bad relationship because you committed one massive ethical crime.

When I was in my early twenties, I dated an amazing guy, whose breath made me want to puke. I kept asking him to please go to the dentist, but he refused (he was afraid of needles) and eventually my attraction to him died down completely. I didn't want to kiss him, I didn't want to hear him speak because I could smell his breath. When I broke up with him, I told him exactly why. He called me superficial for ""overlooking just how awesome we are together, and focusing on one little thing"". However, he actually decided go to the dentist just to ""prove"" to me I'm a hypochondriac and it couldn't possible be this bad, since he doesn't smell it at all, and his teeth don't hurt either.

He called me about 3 months after the break up and said ""My dentist wants me to tell you ""thank you"" on his behalf for forcing me to go"". It turns out he had **severe fucking periodontitis**, his gums were filled with puss (hence the smell) and half his jaw bone was eroded. 

The issue is, periodontitis is contagious. If you kiss someone with the bacteria, you can get it as well, which is what happened to me. No matter how much you brush your teeth after that, it won't work, the bacteria is on your teeth roots and jaw bone and you need medical attention (I had 5 very painful surgeries, and used up my savings at the time).

TL;DR his bad breath could be periodontitis, which also puts YOU at risk of getting it. It's not about him and sex anymore.",432.0,AmItheAsshole,,1436.0

Realizing that is probably why there's more of a push to call it off since you typically have been thinking of the goings on of your relationship if you feel you *must* ask for guidance like this. Typically people might ask their friends or family (if available) so strangers are probably not the first line hearing about it. It's probably got to be eating at the asker or kind of serious to feel the need to ask publicly...

As for OP, this is a really difficult time in her life and the BF is being callous about it.

What she needs, most likely, is a regular predictable time where she can forget about childcare.  I would say you can arrange it anyway you like, an hour every day where you take care of the children (give them baths or read them stories), or maybe a 4 hour block on a weekend where she gets to go out somewhere.  Whatever works for you.

It is really, really important that you both have some skin in each others game here, just for the sake of having empathy for each others experience.  Obviously, she can't come to work with you, but don't shut her out of your work life.  Make sure you do something around the house.  It is worth it for the investment in your relationship.

ETA:  I am very aware that kids vary in temperament.  I had one very cranky baby that rarely slept unless I napped with her, and one easy going kid who was happy rolling around on the floor and could entertain himself for a long time and self soothe.  I had them 23 months apart.  Now maybe this is the baby amnesia talking, but I was still able to find some downtime most days, even if it was in the form of napping with my daughter, or driving around for an extra half hour while both kids slept in the car.  Perhaps I was lucky.  My main point was that it was rarely something I could count on, which made it difficult psychologically.  I think this is what most people don’t get.

Like, good, you're not a complete lump, but cleaning the kitchen (""the whole kitchen"" even, good fucking lord. e.e) isn't anywhere near equal to the work she puts into catering for you both. Cooking isn't just *cooking,* it's:

1. Meal planning. What have you eaten recently? What do you like to eat? What's the weather going to be like? What other commitments do you have? What is your schedule like in the coming week? When can you do grocery shopping and what do you need to use up in the fridge/larder? Is someone else joining you for dinner? +10 to all this planning stuff for dinner parties or dinner guests.
2. Shopping. What ingredients do you need for the meals you've planned. When do you need to buy them? How many shops can you get away with this week? Where's the best place to go? How much will you need to spend? When can you go shopping? After work? Weekend? When is it going to be busy? Oh, shit, the lettuce wilted more quickly than anticipated. Can you go without, or does this need another trip to the shops?
3. Scheduling. How much time is cooking \*today\* going to take up? Am I going to need to prepare anything in advance? Oh shit, I've been held up at work. How does this affect the plan for today?
4. Literal actual cooking time - prep work and active cooking and inactive cooking ('oven time', where she's still keeping an eye and thinking about the food and making sure it doesn't burn or whatever). This is probably an hour to ninety minutes **a day** for dinner. Maybe down to 30 minutes some days, probably more than ninety minutes some days if she's a really good adventurous chef who wants to cook more complex things.
5. Cleaning up. This is - I assume - where you come in. Congratulations! You're helping! e.e

This is just the work that goes into dinner every night, by the way. If she also prepares/organises breakfasts or lunch or weekend meals for you you can multiply the thinking that goes above. And if you're throwing requests on her like some sort of personal chef jukebox there's research and testing and figuring shit out that goes into that as well.

First things first, if she has a normal delivery there is a still a risk of blood clots up until around eight weeks after the birth which is exacerbated by flying.Baby will be at high risk due to low immune system but that’s not a given and baby could be absolutely 100% fine on a plane. Is it a risk she’s worried about? Could you live with yourself if you forced her on that one?

Next, after birth, you usually bleed.  A LOT . Like a FUCKING LOT. Sometimes this can stop after a few days, sometimes this can stop after three months. Mum is therefore right in any apprehension about wearing bathing suits, feeling comfortable on a long flight etc. 

Another point - you can’t do much with a newborn. They sleep, they cry, they poop, they throw up, they drink a tonne of milk. Baby is not going to care what you are doing or what time it is.

If she’s decided to breast feed, she may feel uncomfortable about doing that on a plane or in front of family. If you think “she can just go to the bathroom” well those aren’t very sanitary & it’s underestimating how hard breastfeeding can be if babies are non-stop crying & you don’t really have the space to soothe them other than waving your boob in their face. 

If she’s bottle-feeding, she has the added stress of making up and storing all the bottles correctly & getting them through security. And then of using safe water abroad to make & sterilise bottles with. 

You will all be having a blast - mum probably won’t.

In my own experience, after birth, alllllllllll those pregnancy hormones just dropped out of me & I felt an absolute emotional wreck. You’re trying to figure shit out & you have all those “helpful” family members telling you what to do, you end up snapping & you end up feeling unheard.

This is all if the birth goes well & there’s no problems.

You think, ""FUCK I'm tired of waking up to soothe the baby,"" but as soon as you think that try, ""I'm so grateful I have a family and this is what it takes!"" If you think, ""My wife is being passive aggressive and it's annoying the shit out of me!"" Tell yourself, ""She's just as tired as I am, gotta let it go!"" 

Unless she's like overtly being abusive... that's a different story, but it sounds like you're both just agitated and need some perspective. Try to be more positive when everything in you wants to complain or be frustrated.

It may sound stupid but if you try to combat the negative thoughts with positive ones they take up less space in your brain. Works for me. 😊

I'm a Native American, of the [Salinan Indian Tribe of California.](http://salinantribe.com) (I point this out not to engage in a logical fallacy such as an appeal to authority or an appeal to pity or as an attack on a person--but only to frame my own perspective on this.)

> Recently, I (a white woman) was telling a friend (another white woman) about these plates ... I showed my friend the pictures and told her this, and she told me that I could not keep the plates. She said owning a set of dishes with Native American writing on them was cultural appropriation and I was disrespecting a culture by owning them.

(\*rolls eyes\*)

Okay, first, the only people I've seen complain about ""cultural appropriation"" are ""whites."" (I use the term ""whites"" in quotes because there really is no ""white"" culture, but there is Irish, Scottish, English, French, German, Spanish, and Russian culture, just to name a few groups of folks who generally land under the ""white"" category.) To be blunt, I'm not particularly a fan of someone outside of my tribe or the tribes of other Native Americans to be ""represented"" by an outsider who doesn't know the ways of that tribe. (And one could argue your friends claims about what the Cherokee believe is the real cultural appropriation here.)

(Edit to add: Yes, yes, yes; I know; there are plenty of folks with feathers in headbands running around claiming cultural appropriation. But then when my tribe did its geneaology for application to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, we discovered some of the most vocal ""members of our tribe"" were actually not descendant from the Smithsonian-maintained rolls from the turn of the century or the California rolls maintained as part of a couple of lawsuits. They were instead relatives by marriage--and were not Native American at all. So a lot of folks screaming ""cultural appropriation""--well, I take that sort of thing with a large grain of salt.)

Second, if an object is sacred to a tribe, it sure as hell would not have been sold to someone else for a buck. Native Americans aren't that stupid, ya know...

So no, you're not being an asshole to keep plates inherited from your grandmother, plates your grandmother bought from some Native Americans. Your friend is being a fool and somewhat of an ass trying to represent the opinions and culture of a tribe *she did not grow up in.*

Now, personally, if I knew I had an object with the Sequoyah alphabet on it, I'd be curious and try to translate it. I'd bet a small amount of money that it's either part of the Lord's Prayer or part of the lyrics of Amazing Grace. Both were some of the first works to be translated into a Native American dialect by earlier settlers attempting to convert Native Americans to Christianity.

Which then begs the question: is a Sequoyah translation of a biblical passage cultural appropriation of the Cherokee culture? Or are the Cherokee appropriating Christian culture?

Or is the whole bit about ""cultural appropriation"" just foolish nonsense spouted by overly sensitive whites trying to punch another notch in their ""sensitivity to victims"" card?

Story time: It was a distant acquaintance who hit my (parked) car in my apartment's parking lot. He did this by backing out like a maniac after I had just parked several car lengths behind him. Guess he couldn't be bothered to turn his head or look in his mirror while in reverse.

Anyway, he promised to pay for the damage, but flaked for weeks when I gave him the $400 estimate. I even took it for a second estimate. He refused all contact with me, but continued to park in my building's lot, which perplexed me since we had special decals to park there, but he lived across town. Eventually I found out my neighbor let asshole-driver make a copy of his decal, which was how he was parking there - a forged decal. Once I found this out, I could not WAIT until this guy parked in my lot again. As soon as he did, I called my landlord, and they promptly had him towed. I made sure to stick around for when he got out of class (my building was right next to our college campus) to personally tell him I'd had him towed. His face was priceless. 10/10 would have an asshole towed again.  


This was also how I learned to just call my insurance/the cops if I'm ever hit... I'll never take someone's word that they'll pay again.

TL;DR: Always look behind you when  your car is in reverse. 

Edit: I'll add that it was a particularly well-deserved tow because our lot was over-crowded as it was, so it was definitely not cool of him to forge a decal to park there, as those of us who actually lived there had a hard enough time finding a spot as it was.",420.0,AmItheAsshole,,972.0

Imagine if you told him, ""I need to check your phone and computer, baby! Not because I don't trust you, but because I just need reassurance.""

As much as he's trying to avoid saying it, he doesn't trust you very much. Now maybe that has nothing to do with you and it'd be equally true of any woman he were in a relationship with, but the point is that he doesn't trust you.

Based on what he said, it seems more like he's fixated on the idea of being duped and cuckolded than any particular worry about you. His comment about a ""girl"" ruining his life is weird. And, of course, he's very focused on passing on his genetic lineage. He has a lot of feelings about that. For example, I don't know what he'd think about adopting children if biology is so critical to him.

Yeah, it's concerning. It's hurtful. I often see men say that women just can't understand this anxiety, which is fair, I guess. But I think men *can* understand what it's like to have a partner unfairly accuse them of cheating or insinuate that they're untrustworthy, and then take measures to ""verify"" that they're not cheating.

I don't know what to do with this one, but this is my typical reply to men who demand a DNA test without a specific reason to be doubtful of the paternity: you are entitled to the DNA test, but you're not entitled to a romantic relationship with the mother afterward. When you show such distrust, you really can't ask your partner to just get over being implicitly or explicitly accused of being unfaithful.

So time to talk about options. Could she wear some supportive lingerie that lifts or covers her embarrassing spots?

Babies are attached to their parents, probably especially to mom. Leaving a baby crying in a car is bad for their emotional development. Babies need to feel safe and secure, and they need to know their caretaker is closeby. It is very traumatizing for a baby to be left alone if they are upset. They need their parent to comfort them. I have had a baby (now he's a toddler) and I do my best to never leave him alone when he is crying.

1. I have no family members, just a handful of close friends. We went on a vacation together last year and loved the town, so we decided to have an out of state wedding, so only a few of her family could come to match my few friends. 

2. Keeping it cheap. We aren't making money, we aren't broke. We are just livin.  She has stayed mostly within budget, hired the cheapest package we could get on the beach and we look like we have enough to have a real honeymoon and not just the cheapest Cancun package. 

3. My input? Well honestly I don't really care what happens for a couple hours for one day in our lives, but she's made it super simple, super casual and made it something she and I both can be happy with. We get to have our closest friends and family there. We are getting married on the beach. We are going to eat at a nice place. All things that I wanted more than her, but she also didn't want a big wedding. A lot of what we are doing and have decided on has been her trying to accomodate me and my feelings. 

4. Money. Her family doesn't have much or any. We are paying for most everything ourselves. No big deal. She and I compare prices and options. She's matching my payments and showing concern for our budget. And ya I let her have a little more than we originally discussed, but she didn't take my card and go buy whatever she wanted. 

This chick doesn't want to marry you bro. She doesn't give a fuck about your happiness. She isn't interested in your opinion and she isn't interested in respecting you.

I’m asking because to me, your comment sounds naive. Medicine isn’t like college where if you try your best, you will at least pass. 

If you’re not cut out for med school, they will fail you. They don’t give a shit how passionate you are or how hard you’re working.

The truth hurts.

Say she has a budget as follows:    
Rent:  £1200    
Food:  £300    
Utilities:  £200    
Car note:  £200    
Car insurance:  £100    
Clothing:  £100    
Childcare:  £800    
Savings:  £250    
Entertainment:  £150    
**Total:  £3300**

Rent, utilities, food, and clothing benefit the child, so don't exclude those.  If it was just her alone she could spend less in those areas, but she needs a bigger living space and more food and a bigger clothing budget so your child can, you know, *live.*  Savings also benefit your kid because savings are critical for stability. 

Then you pay her £150 for child support (which is a fucking pittance, by the way).  Now she has an extra  £150 in her budget, so she puts that towards her childcare costs.  The rest of her costs don't increase along with your child support, you are contributing to the existing costs that HELP YOUR CHILD FUCKING LIVE.  Since now there's an extra £150 of *her* money that used to go to childcare, she can put it into other parts of her budget, including entertainment.

1. A Roman Catholic baptism is not necessarily a profession of faith on the part of the baptized, it merely represents a willingness to explore said faith, and a commitment on the part of the godparents to help teach the neophyte about Catholicism. If baptized, your son would grow up around the Church (just as you did), but would still be free to make his own decisions when he comes of age (just as you did). We have a separate sacrament for when you're ready to join in the Eucharist, another to affirm your beliefs in front of the community (Confirmation, typically around 6-8th grade), and another still for when you've decided on your vocation. 
We have seven of these things, they cover just about every major life event you can imagine.

2. If you are not a part of the Church, and not present at the baptism, no reasonable person is going to hold you to the promises made by parents at the baptism, i.e. raising their child with an understanding of Catholic mythology. You will still be free to raise your child as you see fit when you have custody. In fact, this situation may prove beneficial, as your child will have exposure to both a theist worldview and an agnostic/athiest one, allowing him to make a more informed decision later on in life.

Your post explicitly says that Lucy was abandoned once by her mother, then emotionally abandoned by her father and stepmom *right when a girl needs her mother figure the most.* This comment, from your own words, says **You abandoned her** for your other children after her mother left her. 

You abandoned her right when a girl becomes a young woman. So Lucy left to find solace and acceptance in the arms of a young man who became the father of her child. Note that she **explicitly said she doesn’t want to abandon her child**. ***She already knows how that feels and doesn’t want that for her child***.

**You had the opportunity to stay close to nurture and guide this *already abandoned daughter* during her formative years and failed**. And now that Lucy is at her most vulnerable and endangered you want to send her away. Honestly...you didn’t even notice Lucy was pregnant for four months? You didn’t see or hear her vomiting, gaining weight, or even sleeping with guys? What the hell is going to happen when your younger children grow older and begin to test limits? Are you going to throw them out too? Your younger children will have witnessed an example of their parents’ awful capacity for compassion and patience. 

You say you’ve sent Lucy to therapy on and off, **but therapy is useless unless you are making changes at home to accommodate therapeutic growth**. Think of that this way; Lucy has been living off a diet of Cheetos and snickers for years. If you knew she needed to get healthy, would you give her vitamins? Or would you introduce her to healthier food? You have been feeding her an awful family home life and supplementing it with insufficient help. Now she’s sick and you’re going to abandon her again by sending her away. 

**You need to seek out family therapy. You have needed this for a while now**.

**You need to get Lucy prenatal health and psych care throughout her pregnancy**. ***Even if she doesn’t carry this pregnancy to term* Lucy needs healthcare yesterday**.

**You need to tell Lucy’s biological mother the situation**.

**You need to apologize for her and take this opportunity to raise her properly with love and care for the first time**.

**You need to be an example for your younger children about whether you are trustable when they get in trouble. They will get in trouble one day, that’s life**.

***If Lucy gives birth*** you need to examine how you feel about her giving birth. **Do NOT throw your daughter out of the house if you feel there is any possibility you might want a relationship with your grandchild at one time**. ***Accept your grandchild now or never.  You only get one shot to accept or abandon this grandchild***. **You might want to end the family cycle of abandonment**. **This is where therapy comes in for you, OP, and your wife**.

You were flirting with the waitress. That's how your date saw it.

She sees a prospective partner ""throwing away"" $100 on a tip where the normal tip range for a meal for two people would be in the $5-15 range. Again, she may see this as signs of flirting(either with the waitress or as a power move to try and impress the date). Normal working class people do not tip $100 unless they've won the lottery or they want to impress someone.

I was a young mom. 19 years old with our barely 1 year old child. I couldn’t drive, I couldn’t leave to grocery shop. I was trapped 24 - 72 hrs at a time in the house with our child. 

Now, I cooked. I cleaned. I took care of our kid and made sure he was washed, fed, and his toys were clean and he had stuff to do. But I *never* got to take time for myself. Ever. I lost all my hobbies because I was literally the only parent 50% of the time. 

But the other 50% of the time when my supposed partner was home? He played video games. He threw trash on the ground. He ignored our kid. He demanded take out. He demanded that I *did not leave*. I had to spend time with him. So my son and I had to sit on the couch while he played games. The only time I truly left the house was when we went grocery shopping. 

The resentment I feel towards my ex is insurmountable. He would scream at me and get drunk, saying that his job was so hard and that he needed to relax. That was *fine*. What wasn’t fine was the complete disconnect that I still had to do everything and basically had two kids when he was around. It was *miserable*. When he was home, the house would be trashed. I got so overwhelmed because I’m one person looking after a small person, while the other person who is supposed to be helping is making everything *worse*. 

It was awful. I wasn’t asking him to do 50% of the chores. I wasn’t asking him to completely take over. I was asking for him to do the dishes after I cooked. I was asking him to watch our kid while I went to the bathroom. I was asking him to put his clothes away. I was asking him to *stop throwing trash on the ground.*

Being the primary caretaker of a child is stressful, overwhelming, and all consuming. There are no breaks and they constantly need your attention. My son is 3 now and is pretty independent — *But I still need help.* 

In my opinion, asking your partner to do the *bare minimum* when it comes to their living space and spawn is not ridiculous. It’s still their house, and that is definitely still their kid. They should step up and help.",411.0,AmItheAsshole,,2322.0

*  In so much as you are able to objectively look at this, how much of your decision is based upon ""Fuck her, I want her to suffer like she has made me suffer!"" Vs ""She contributed absolutely nothing to the raising of the kids and the operation of our household/lives for the entirety of our marriage.""   

*  From a moral standpoint, if she is worthy of compensation on the second metric but your primary motivation is some sense of punishment or justice,  then you would be morally wrong.  You being morally wrong in that regard DOES NOT mean that what she did is okay or should be without punishment.   

*  You do not see being a stay-at-home mom as being a ""hard"" job, but the reality is that staying at home and raising three children IS hard and it IS stressful.  It's certainly not the same kind of stress as working 12 hour days in an office, which is also not the same kind of stress as working 12 hour days on a construction site.  It is very difficult (and I think dangerous) to play the game of ""Who has the harder life/job"" because everyone handles different kinds of stress differently.  One part of being the best we can be as people is empathizing with another's lot in life and being able to appreciate the adversity they experience *from their perspective*.   To deny this experience that women (or men) feel is to devalue everyone that commits to raising children.  There is time, effort, and ultimately (especially in the context of this discussion) value in raising kids.  That is (ideally, though not without flaws) what the courts attempt to determine when handing down spousal support settlements - to set aside the emotion of the moment and focus on past actions as they relate to ""work"" contributed for the benefit of the family.

*  All of that aside,  what kind of relationship do you want to have with your children and future grandchildren, and what monetary value do you place on that relationship?  If your daughter's view is in support of your Ex, surely you have to ask why?  Is it possible that they empathize with her view of this story?  Will they resent you or think less of you if you don't pay?  

You seem to be in the dream scenario most people would fantasize about when betrayed by their spouse, of being able to get the upper hand and punish them for their wrongdoing.  It isnt wrong to feel the way that you do, nor would it be wrong to forgive the spouse and accept the reality of the emotional pain without embracing the need for vengeance.

You really don’t care about your kids. Or if you do, you’re letting your exhaustion get the best of you, and you’re going to regret severing ties like that. People don’t forget. They may move on, but they’re going to remember the time their dad ditched.

You implored the kids once they were “adults.” Why not before? Why didn’t you take any actions or precautions prior to this point? Even if you couldn’t anticipate the divorce happening, did you ever teach your kids about financial literacy, lawsuits, or mental disorders? There’s not a lot of information here, so maybe you were a wonderful father and lived up to all expectations and the kids fucked themselves over. But given your incredible callousness, I’m inclined to believe you didn’t properly educate them and then pulled a surprised Pikachu face when they didn’t suddenly become competent at the age of 18.

I get that it’s difficult for you. You’re an abuse victim as well, and this sounds like a shitty situation you had to fight alone. But of course your kids are going to struggle. They’ve spent their entire lives in that abusive household, and you seem to be expecting way too much of them.

You don’t have to fight their battles for them. But you can stick around and support them. Make yourself available, instead of waving it off as “it’s up to them.” Help them out with the lawsuit.

So, you're both agreed that you absolutely do not want children; that's awesome, I'm glad you're both on the same page. But it sounds like actually making sure of that falls entirely on him.

All the people calling you the asshole are totally unreasonable. He is not an asshole for doing the right thing by his kids. You are not an asshole for not wanting a huge change in your life. The parameters that you entered this relationship with have changed. You explicitly said that you did not play the role of a mother to them, and that you did not sign up for doing so. Being a part time parent who does a few fun activities is a completely different kettle of fish to being a full time parent.

Also, and I'll call out what is clearly in your mind and just as clearly not occurring to all the YTAers - there is often a huge discrepancy between how much work gets assigned in the work of raising children. Your partner has been a semi-dad for years. He hasn't done the equivalent hard work (2 days as opposed to 5). He's probably not even slightly prepared for the reality of three kids under twelve on a constant basis, and just how much that is going to change your lives, in a way that you are prepared for because you've already done your time. It is absolutely not impossible that you will end up doing more heavy lifting in the work of childrearing than your partner, even though they are his kids and not yours. Plenty of research shows that women consistently even with full time jobs, get lumped with significantly more childcare and housework than their male counterparts. This is not a negligible worry - it will breed resentment and frustration as years you had envisaged as being about you after 18 years of being about a kid, become another 9 years of being about a kid.

You would be the asshole if you made this about his kids in any way other than telling him that you know you wouldn't be able to provide the stable full-time care that his kids will need in the transition from what sounds like an unstable current living situation. This is not a judgement on him or them, this is you choosing to bow out of something you know you can't handle.

Your partner will think YTA. The kids will think YTA. But then nobody in this scenario is *ever* going to put you first. The kids because they're kids. Your partner because frankly his kids matter more (as they should). Which means that at some point you're going to have to pick yourself, because no-one else will. For years. People who think you should suck that up have clearly never been in this situation and aren't thinking long term. 

In future though, don't date anyone with young kids. That was the initial mistake as nobody can predict scenarios like this and as you've found out there's no easy neat solution that won't leave you feeling terrible, and everyone else as well.

It's a messy, sad and difficult situation. But that doesn't necessitate there being an asshole at all.

Edited to add: I also don't think the people who voted YTA are considering the results of shaming you into this. Not just for you (the inevitable loss of freedom, time, possibly financial hardship, relationship difficulties) but also for the kids. While you may be a familiar face in their life, you are not their mother (and regardless of people trying to guilt you here, as they have a full-time mum, they quite clearly don't think you're magically their mum either). They might not even want you around right now - instead being very reliant on their dad as their new most important stable family figure. Three years is still relatively new on the scene, feelings will be very raw right now - they may very well not want or be looking for a pseudo-mum after being deeply hurt by their own. Everyone is acting like the kids are going to be paralysed with grief by your call, and nobody is even considering that the kids may be relieved that this is one less relationship to navigate right now.",400.0,AmItheAsshole,,2765.0

I once found a little old dog wandering around...she was shaggy and her nails were long and she had bad teeth. Nothing awful, just not ideal. I took her to the shelter to get scanned for a chip and they insisted I should turn her in because she was *clearly* abused. Instead I walked around the neighborhood and found her owners out searching two streets over. Turns out she was a bit unkempt because she was sixteen and had cancer, so her owners didn't want to stress her with grooming or put her through a risky dental. She was just a little dying old lady spending her last days with her family. I have no doubt that if I had turned her in at the shelter she would have been dead within an hour, legal or not.

Former gay teen and current gay adult here. This is a really good time to sit down with her and ask her why she feels that way. There may be things that bother her that you didn't even realize. Your reaction to her coming out sounds wonderful, but it still doesn't change that it is a really hard thing to do. 

In my experience, coming out was hard enough, but when my mom acted like she had 0 problem with gay people and refused to even have a conversation with me about my opinion on that.... that was a wedge that eventually drove us completely apart. (my coming out was much like you expressed, it was what came after that became an issue) This isn't to say you may secretly hate gay people, but understand that our society as a whole is not very accepting of LGBTQ people and many well meaning, kind people hold homophobic views and don't even realize it. It doesn't mean you hate, it just means you haven't heard a different perspective before.

I would just check in with her. Again, for me it was very hurtful that my mom had already made up her mind that she was 100% not homophobic at all when I came out and therefore blocked all conversation about how I felt about how I was treated. I think a lot of straight parents struggle with this fact: You have no experience in your child's shoes as an LGBTQ person, please remember that and don't approach this situation as correct vs. incorrect.

Honestly, that's the type of information that she should have volunteered in the first couple of dates.  Most people need sex to be part of their relationships.  So it stands to reason that most people who she finds to date are going to want sex to be an option.  By not mentioning it until the relationship has gotten serious, she's setting herself -- and her partner -- up for pain, disappointment, and heartbreak.

She's probably thinking that if she can just get someone to love her enough before springing the ""no sex ever"" talk on them, they'll stick around.  But that's just asking for an unhealthy relationship.  She needs to find someone who is also asexual, or is otherwise okay with never having sex.  And her current approach isn't going to accomplish that.

>Tbh we mostly avoided that line of conversation because the entire aspect of it seemed to make her uncomfortable.

I'm sorry to hear that, because it sounds like this is a situation that's going to feed on itself.  She's going to find someone else, not mention being asexual for a long time, and then be hurt yet again when he breaks it off with her.  That, in turn, is going to make it even more uncomfortable/stressful for her to talk about her asexuality in the future.  Or, even worse, the next guy will stick around because he loves her enough to deal with no sex, and will eventually seek it out elsewhere, or grow to resent her.

I hope she can find a way to be comfortable enough to bring this up after just a couple of dates with someone.

 Especially apple with the peeling, coring slicing, etc.  And then if you make your own crust it's a struggle to make sure you get the right ratio of butter and flour and not overwork the dough...

And even more so if cooking isn't your thing and you hate apple pie.  You made the effort to bake something that you don't have experience in, that he specifically asked for, that he knows you don't like and won't eat it...and he refused to taste it? 

 I'm pissed for you.  It shouldn't have mattered that it looked weird.  You aren't a professional chef.  Your pie isn't going to look like that perfectly baked apple pie on TV, the recipe sheet, like the pies that you can from a bakery or supermarket.  And that's ok. You're not a baker or a professional patisserie chef or even an armchair chef.  Yeah, it might look a bit weird but that is no excuse to refuse trying it.

If you do decide to try and make another apple pie, share it with people who care about you no matter what it ends up looking and tasting like.

Also, just a tip, for apple pies, Granny Smith apples and whatever the recipe says for cinnamon, double it.

The fact that he is a bigger asshole for cheating on his wife and lying to you about his relationship status is actually irrelevant.  It also doesn't matter that his wife is mad at you instead of mad at the person she should truly be angry with.  That's all fucking irrelevant.

*friends for a reason*

*friends for a season*

*friends for a lifetime*

That’s what my grandma always told me. She also told me 

“A person being nice doesn’t make them your friend. Spending a lot of time with someone doesn’t make them your friend.”

Friends are people who care about you. They talk to you even when it’s hard.

This person is no longer a friend to you. He didn’t even attempt to bring his fiancé’s concerns about you to you. He didn’t give you the opportunity to try to mend that relationship. 

Also, I think the rest of your friend group going to the wedding are inconsiderate as well. 

Maybe you should take this as a sign that you need better people in your life. I know my friends would never talk about his much fun an even was going to be around me if they knew that everyone was invited except for me, **especially** if there was an expectation among everyone that I would be invited and there was an emotional component.

There are some wedding traditions in American culture that could be seen as misogynistic, for instance the father of the bride ""giving her away"". I don't know anything about your culture so I can't say how misogynistic it is in context, but it sounds like it is a really important tradition for your parents.  

Is there maybe some way you can blend the ""bride price"" into an American wedding tradition?  For instance, American tradition is that the groom's family provides the meal the night before the wedding, as a gift to the bride's family.  Maybe they can do this and include some sort of ceremonial gift, rather than actual money?  

Check out the book The Gift by Lewis Hyde, in it he discusses gifts and their meanings around the world.  In many cultures, the bride (and her fertility) is a ""gift"" given from her family to the groom's family, if this is the case in your culture, maybe it kind of makes sense for the groom's family to provide a ""gift"" back to your family to honor their role in raising you and their acknowledgement of the sacrifice in ""giving you up"". 

Obviously it's your wedding and you can do whatever you want without being the asshole.  Women are no longer objects to be owned by men, and as another woman I say thank fucking goodness for that, amen.  

But if you want to throw your family a bone here, you can talk to them about the deeper meaning and significance of the bride price and then maybe you can come up with a creative solution to honor that tradition and your culture without reinforcing the misogynistic message.

There was no reason for you to be expected to pay. I think it’s trickier when someone invites you out to eat, but you were a guest and she offered to make a meal. I’ve never heard of anyone expecting the bill to be split for a grocery bill when you’re the guest. I think in this situation it is often seen as polite/appropriate to bring something to dinner like a dessert or side dish since you’re a guest. But in my opinion, it’s super weird to invite someone over and ask them to pay, especially without talking to them first if there was some kind of financial situation or something where they felt it was needed.

Why the hell not?

In all seriousness, though...OP, I work in events, and I think you're not thinking things through. Yes, there is a massive potential for drama. But your families are going to be really intertwined after this. If you begin your marriage by bending over backwards for the sake of homophobic dipshits, at the cost of your relationship with your brother (and this WILL damage your relationship with your brother), you are setting yourself up to be walked all over.

Obviously, you and your fiance don't want to deal with this on your wedding day. Neither does your brother or his husband. But there ARE people who would DELIGHT in dealing with this. A trusted friend with a protective streak (the kind of person who spills red wine on a MIL's white dress) who has a couple of security guards at their disposal might go a looooong way towards making this a much easier night.

Absolutely have a conversation with your brother. Say, ""Shit might go down but if it does, it'll be covered."" That is what a supportive sibling does. Then have a conversation with your MIL/FIL to be. Tell them your gay brother is going to be there with his husband so you would appreciate them keeping their homophobia under wraps for the night. It's very likely that they are fully capable of shutting up for the night. But make it very clear on no uncertain terms that no one who disrespects your brother will remain at your wedding.

And then, well, all the drama is already taken care of. Talk to your trusted friend and the security guards. Shit very well might go down at your wedding, and if it does, you already know exactly what will happen: the people who caused it will be immediately removed. You have removed the potential for drama by already resolving any potential issues in advance.",389.0,AmItheAsshole,,1831.0

- 150g/5oz sundried tomatoes
- 300g/10oz cherry tomatoes
- 48oz strained tomatoes (passata, etc)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1tbsp extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2tsp anchovy paste
- 1/2 a large red onion
- 5 basil leaves
- parmesan cheese
- salt and pepper

10-15 minutes before cooking, crush the garlic and set aside. This develops a chemical called allicin within responsible for taste. Let sit for at least 10 minutes, then finely mince. Dice the salami into small cubes, entirely preferential but I like 1x1x1cm cubes. Blitz sundried tomatoes in a processor until thick paste. Finely chop red onion.

Oil in the pan on medium heat. Bring up to heat enough that it flows around the pan effortlessly. Add the salami. Cook 3-4 minutes or until slightly firm, the goal is to impart flavor to the oil. Then add the garlic and cook until fragrant (1-2min). Then immediately add the onion and cook for an additional 4-5 minutes until the red onion changes from purple and white to translucent orange. Adding the onion stops the garlic from cooking and potentially burning as the onion contains water. Red onion will taste very similar to other onions, but is a weaker flavor overall. You can use a spanish onion if you'd like but we want a strong tomato taste, not really an onion taste.

Add the whole cherry tomatoes ensuring they're touching the bottom of the pan and are not on top of other things. Cook for 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften, then smoosh them against the sides of the pan. This will release the pectin inside. Cherry tomatoes contain a lot of pectin and are generally sweeter, so it both sweetens the sauce and makes it thicker with less reduction and less cooking. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.

Move everything to one side of the pan and add the anchovy paste and sundried tomatoes to the empty side. Stir those around to combine and cook for 1-2 minutes. Then combine both sides and stir to combine. Both the anchovy paste and sundried tomatoes will amplify the other flavors present as they contain a lot of glutamates.

After 2-3 minutes of further cooking, add the strained tomatoes and 24oz further of water. Since previously you cooked the cherry tomatoes, the sweetness from them will cut down the acidity of the strained tomatoes. Mix very well and bring up to medium-high heat until it begins to bubble. Then taper off the heat until you can maintain a simmer. Stir occasionally and simmer until it reduces to your desired thickness, anywhere from 5-10 minutes. Then remove from heat.

Another pot of water seasoned with salt brought to a rolling boil. Put in your pasta of choice and cook until al dente. I like orechiette, farfalle, or just plain penne. Strain and return to the pot. Add a ladle or two full of the sauce to the pasta and combine. Take the basil leaves and stack them on top of each other and roll up very tightly, like a cigar. Slice parallel to the stem once and then make perpendicular slices until you have tiny slivers. Also grate parmesan cheese. Serve pasta in a bowl topped with the parmesan, basil, and an extra ladle of sauce.

Total time 20-30min excluding 10-15min prep and 7-10min cooking pasta. Makes 6-7 cups of sauce, enough to serve 10-15 bowls of pasta in my experience. Keeps in fridge for 4-5d, in freezer for 4-5mo.

For vegetarian/vegan options, omit the salami and anchovy paste. An alternative for the salami might be using chili flakes added with the garlic or using a chili pepper infused olive oil. For the anchovy paste, either mushrooms or extra sundried tomatoes. I evidently don't have a lot of expertise in this area, so just look for ingredients that can boost the flavor. Avoid worcestershire sauce as it contains anchovies.

This sauce was intentionally made simple and using the least ingredients possible. Some changes you could do are:

- using chicken or beef stock in lieu of water after you add the strained tomatoes; will change the taste to be less tomato-y but still amplify some of the other flavors
- with the onion add in 2 grated stalks of celery and 1 grated carrot; look up what a mirepoix or soffrito is to learn more. It's hard to explain
- adding a bay leaf or other herbs like parsley or oregano
- using canned whole tomatoes instead; will change the texture a lot
- you can add lots of different things to it including sliced olives, chopped anchovy fillets, chopped capers, mushrooms, etc to your preference

Pasta sauce is really a subjective thing and is extremely open to experimentation. I personally try to use very little meat since I want something tomato forward. Your mileage may vary with adding extra meat.",387.0,AmItheAsshole,,3146.0

Your dad is being wildly inappropriate with your wife. 

Remember that while you are a blood relation to him, your wife is not. Therefore the visceral reaction against viewing each other as sexual creatures are not hardwired between him and her. She must necessarily view him as a sexual being who is coming too close to her AND is not respecting her refusals.

You are ALSO an asshole for excusing him with autism. I, too, am on the spectrum and while it's true that many of us miss social cues we do understand being told to stop. You told him to stop and he did, so he clearly understood it. And then the behaviour crept back in gradually. Which is exactly how abuse is ramped up so no one will call it out, because it's just a tiny step more than last time and therefore no worse, and last time it was tolerable. Right? This isn't autism. This is an abuser pushing her boundaries and has nothing to do with whether or not he's on the spectrum.

You wanna be tolerant and considerate of your dad's peculiarities and what YOU perceive to be undiagnosed autism, but what about your wife's anxiety? When does she get your tolerance and consideration for her mental health? Or do you think she gets sufficient amounts of that from her therapist?

I almost don't dare ask why your wife has issues with older men. Aside from the anxiety. Have you ever asked her why that is? Was she perchance abused by an older man? Is your father unknowingly triggering old trauma? 

And for additional escalation. Just to really rub in what one might overlook from your POV:

Incidentally, autistic lack of understanding of social conventions can by the untrained armchair psychologist easily be mistaken (and vice versa) for the psycho-/sociopath's disdain for and unwillingness to adhere to those ground rules. It's unlikely, yes, but in theory your dad could be a skilled sociopath, who has correctly identified an easy victim and is knowingly stepping all over her boundaries because it's amusing to him.

Read through your post and edit. Notice how many times you mention you (me me me) and how many times you mention Lucy and her struggles. To be short, you're fucking self centered. Extremely. Look at your edit ""Why am **I** the villain"", etc. You say I or Me (in regards to Lucy and her kid) 8 times. You mention Lucy 4 times. Half as much.

Me me me me. That's you. Right now.

You're worried that you can't pay for it. Not how Lucy will pay for it the next 18 years if she's on her own. You're worried that you look like the villain. Not how people view a 15 year old pregnant girl. You didn't sign up to raise a child. But you make no mention of Lucy and whether she signed up for it (more on this later). You're worried about how you're responsible for Lucy till she turns 18. But not how Lucy is responsible till her child turns 18. You didn't sign up for a child. Did Lucy? Did you even fucking ask her? Do you even know how she ended up pregnant? She's been hanging around older guys, how do you know something didn't happen against her will? Do you even know the guy? Does Lucy? Do you even know how all of this came to happen? Fuck, **do you even know what is going on in your own daughters life?**

You're a self centered... well I'll try and follow the rules. And it's no struggle to see Lucy turned out the way she did.

I was gunna type out a whole thing about why kids act out, the psychology of it (one of my fields of study), and how you've had 8 years to do better than you have. But I won't. It would be long. Judgmental. And probably break one of the rules of the sub. Not to mention I imagine it won't have much effect on someone who *considers kicking out a pregnant 15 year old girl who's possibly already been the victim of older predatory men* which would basically be *throwing her to the fucking sharks*. So I'll say this.

Sit down. Clear your head. And spend fifteen minutes of your obviously important life imagining you are Lucy.

Imagine your mom completely disappearing from your life at a crucial stage of your development. When you don't really understand why she left, and (most likely) think that she doesn't love you, as mom no longer has time for you in her new life.

Imagine you get attention you crave from acting out and being unreasonable. And that people are *finally* looking at, and paying attention to you. Attention you wish mom was around to give you.

Imagine that your sole parental figure is a man, which means all that girl stuff is *really* difficult to talk to him about. And, oh! now he's married again and has other kids, and less time for you. Better act out more for more attention.

Imagine that boys give you attention. They say nice things to you. Make you feel good about yourself. Everything feels better when they talk to you, and you don't worry as much. Now older boys come along. Oh my, their so *cool* and *sophisticated* and they *drive* and hangout late. AND they still tell you how pretty you are. How beautiful and smart you are. They always seem to support you, even when dad doesn't. It's been a while since you've heard things like that....

Now. Imagine you're sitting down at a table with your Dad and step Mom. You sat them down like an adult, to talk like adults. You're scared. I mean **fucking scared shitless**. It probably took a week to get the courage up just to ask them to sit down. You're the resident fuck up, you know it, Dad makes sure of that. And what you are about to tell him is just going to probably cement that for the rest of your life. But you've made a choice, and you're sure of that choice, and for once, **just for fucking once** you'd like to have support in it.....

Now open your eyes. And maybe, I fucking hope, you'll have a modicum of fucking empathy for your **15 year old pregnant daughter**.",387.0,AmItheAsshole,,3910.0

She didn’t pick up the slack. You did what you had to do to keep yourself from breaking.

THEN she’s cold and possessive. Which is understandable and reasonable. For some reason she didn’t want your mom coming to help.

THEN she brings up an argument the two of you had to a friend you were *both at lunch with*. It’s her friend. She needs support. But not appropriate time to bring it up.

The bigger guy likely knew he was inflicting this predicament on someone, I doubt he's that unaware of his size.

Look, I don't doubt what she did was beyond heartless and a sign of betrayal to the 7+ years you two spent together. She knew better, yet still decided to do something so gravely wrong without considering all the consequences. 
And that actions of hers surely caused a very emotional reaction on your side. 

However, as far as I've understood this, you didn't acknowledge her side of the story. Yeah, sounds stupid, but cheating does not necessarily mean she hated you and abused your trust and money for the whole time. Are all your emotions of 7 years gone suddenly? 

You feel betrayed and angry, yes. But it's doubtful whether or not it was alright just throwing all her stuff and her out without both a warning and a talk, plus also blocking her everywhere. She fucked up big time and you punish her like she was your enemy. She broke your heart, you probably destroyed her career. 

Maybe I'm wrong and actually acting like TA here...and maybe you actually did good by cutting her off. But to me, it rather seems you need to take a few days of rest and talk to her. It sucks. But you hardly will get clarity just by going into extremes. 

She acted immorally, you immaturely.

Good luck to both of you, still.

I'm a stepdad, I have a stepdad, and everything I learned about being a stepdad came from watching fucked up my stepdad was and is.  Let's break this down:

1. Your dad is in the picture.  You call him dad.  As a stepdad, you are not a replacement.  You are a parental figure.  With my kids, sometimes they call me dad and I melt.  Most times they don't and I'm perfectly happy with that too.  They look to me as a parental figure, not necessarily as a replacement.  The oldest claims I'm her real dad (their biological father is actually in the picture) and says that because of my parenting techniques.  I relate to her.  She relates to me.  The younger sees me as a strong father figure, but not as dad.  And that is okay.  I'm not their to change their minds.  They have to respect me.  But that really doesn't take much.
2. I understand why you're uncomfortable.  Something like this is personal.  You don't get to show up and just be dad, then make things uncomfortable about a right you don't have.  It's not okay and frankly a bit weird.  You were well within your rights to move in with your dad.  
3. You chose to move out for the sake of your mental health.  Your stepdad was doing things that made you uncomfortable and then retaliating when he didn't get his way.  This isn't like you not doing chores, or staying out past curfew.  You did what you needed to in order to stay sane.  I applaud that.

So yes, you are well within your right to ask he not be there.  He is the source of your discomfort, the source of mental anguish, and the reason you left your previous living situation.  What he was asking for and doing in retaliation is just wrong.  That is the quickest way to push a kid away from you.  That's why I took the exact opposite approach in my own life as stepdad.  I love those kids like they are my own, but I will never ask or demand they call me dad.  That's a title you earn, even as a biological father, not one you're just given.",380.0,AmItheAsshole,,1969.0

Everyone is calling this guy an asshole, but what about the fact that his GF completely lied to him?

She promised him that she'd use the pill and 100% abort if she concieved. She did, and now she's going back on her word. If I was OP I'd be absolutely furious.

It's easy to tell him ""Well it's your responsibility to wrap your dick"" but if I was in a relationship I'd expect to trust my partner enough so that if she said she was on the pill and would abort if conceived, that she'd keep her word. This is a big fucking deal for OP as well as her, ESPECIALLY if he isn't a US citizen. 

We don't know what her motivations are. Perhaps she fucked up, or perhaps she tricked him. She could be wanting to ""trap"" him, so to speak. It's happened before. It's EXTREMELY suspicious that she went out of her way to promise him that if he stopped using a condom, she would do x y z and then immediately became pregnant. If she really didn't want a kid, she'd take the proper precaution and then if she became pregnant stick to her word. 

She's not automatically innocent because she's a woman, and we shouldn't be automatically giving her the benefit of the doubt. I'm a woman and I know a lot of fucked up girls who joke about ""trapping"" hot guys for all kinds of reasons. It's awful and OP has a right to be very upset. Not only that, he is actually being UNSELFISH by saying that he isn't ready to have a kid and thus wants her to abort. If he really didn't care, he'd say fuck it do what you want, I'm leaving anyway.  

OP, I'm gonna say NTA. I think you should give her the ultimatum and that you should start looking into your legal rights immediately. The truth is she may be able to have the baby and you might be fucked. I don't know how it works with non US citizens.

For situations like these, parents should praise effort rather than ability. That way, you’re encouraging the kid for trying their hardest to solve puzzles rather than encouraging them for being  good at puzzles. 

Example:

DON’T:
“Wow you’re so good at this video game.”
That’s praising his ability rather than his effort. This is a problem because as soon as he reaches a tough “puzzle” and has difficulty solving it, it’s going to have his worldview of him being good at video games invalidated. This typically results in kids quitting. 

DO:
“Wow, i really like how much effort you’re putting in to solving this tough part of the video game!”
That’s praising his effort rather than his ability. This encourages him to try harder to solve the puzzle and reinforces the process. Praise specific methods he’s trying and his effort to complete it. Additionally, this is much better than harshly telling him he’s a quitter. That will just make him feel unsupported and put down.

But consider this: I grew up in the Hollywood Hills. There are very, very few kids in those neighborhoods, there are very few sidewalks, many winding roadings with self-important Hollywood types speeding up and down who will easily hit you walking down tiny, tight roads, and the elevation change as you walk through neighborhoods can be a bit much just for Halloween. But it's an affluent neighborhood. Yet pretty much everyone drives their kids elsewhere for Halloween and I have many fond memories as a kid trick or treating in my friend's neighborhoods down in the flatlands.
And now I don't really want to sit at my door and hand out candy, so I buy a dozen bags of it and leave it in a huge bucket on my porch. Most years the kids are very respectful and take only their fair share. Last night some kid threw my bucket across the lawn, candy going everywhere.
Meh, whatever. Kids can be assholes, but the majority of them had a good experience last night, even if I couldn't be bothered to open the door and ask what they were supposed to be.
Just chill man, if you live in an affluent neighborhood, you can afford to buy a fuckload of candy. It's only money, and you can always get more of it. Fun coupons, that's what I like to call them. What you can't get more of is TIME. So stop arguing with your gf and enjoy handing out candy with her.

If you accepted this job just so your wife could stay home, I see your request as a little more reasonable. That is a LOT of hours to work. 

If you would have accepted this job either way and your wife decided to keep working, you would still be doing chores without complaining, right? 

I don’t think there is a perfect answer here. With no hired help, your wife will also be “working” (taking care of the kids, cleaning, cooking, shopping) just as much as you are & all alone while you are gone for 60-80 hours a week. When you get off work and come home & expect to not contribute to basic cleaning, fixing, cooking, her “work day” gets extended to 24/7.  

I’m not saying she should not lift a finger to clean & cook all day and expect you to do it all when you get home, but if she has been doing these tasks (amongst other things) and a couple chores are left by the end of the day, by all means you should help her finish them. 

Personally, I could NEVER be a SAHM. I would rather work 100 hours a week. Try to see things from her point of view. Hopefully, when you get home from work you get a mental break & can turn “off” from work. She will never get that same break unless you help her out some. Maybe 50/50 is not a correct balance, but it’s definitely not 100/0.

It is absolutely disguisting your surrugate smoked and drank during the pregnancy. I cannot imagine how horrified you must have been by that revelation. It is no excuse at all that she was stressed and it was extremely irresponsible that she handled it like that.

That being said, smoking and drinking has very little influence on stuff like Down sindrome and spina bifida. It is extremely unlikely that her behaviour is what caused those conditions, so at this point her behaviour has no influence on my judgement.

You knew before you became parents that your baby could be born with a congenital condition. If it were your wife pregnant she could abort in that case, yes, but you knew very well that if you got a surrugate, that was most likely not an option. You can't force somebody else to have an abortion. You knew all that, you had years to think about it, had many appointments with doctors and the agency. You knew that was a chance and you still decided to go trought with it. This girl is carrying a baby for you for no compensation at all. Its not her baby. She took a chance, a huuuuge chance (she could have all sorts of complications or even die during pregnancy, and even a normal, smooth pregnancy is really hard) on you. Now when your baby has a condition like that, you want to either force her to abort at 5 months (extremely traumatic! and illegal!) or stick her with a special needs  baby that even you as a couple that has wanted kids for years thinks they can't handle? Or what, stick the baby in the sistem? Honestly, with this attitude, you never should have been parents at all.

For me it boils down to this:  The baby having special needs is a thing you should have considered BEFORE getring a surrogate. And if your solution then was to opt out if it happened, you never should have gotten a surrogate at all.

I think it would be reasonable to  ask her if she would be willing to abort (assuming that is possible due  to the medical conditions). But if she says no, you can't just opt out of taking YOUR baby you ASKED her to carry for you. If you did that yeah, you would be huge, gigantic assholes. (And just a warning, you would probably make news as well.)

If she does abort, seriously rethink if you want to be parents at all. And if so, for god's sake adopt a child that needs it and that you are sure you can take care of.

They didn't want to feel like they were bad parents.

Their son hit and bit and broke everything. For his own safety, and theirs, they had to remove everything except a mattress from his room. For thirteen years, his mother did not have a night of unbroken sleep.

In the interview, the father described his feelings when they left their son at the facility. That his son probably couldn't understand how hurt they were, how much he hurt them, and how sorry they were. He only knew that the only people in the world that he ever truly knew were leaving him, alone, in a strange place. 

He also describes the first home visit after that. How their son walked into a house that had changed so much while he was gone, but he didn't melt down. He was calm and happy. The care facility gives him appropriate activities throughout the day so he's never bored. They take care of him. As his father drove him back to the facility, he played a kind of game, where he says,""The letter D!"" And his father responds, ""And D is for...""

Don't know why more people don't understand this on a fundamental level. If you marry someone who has 2 kids from a previous relationship now you essentially have 2 kids yourself. If you cant handle this fact than you don't get married to a person with 2 kids... 

The physical abuse may have stopped, probably because it came to a point where you're stepdad got scared you could physically whoop his ass back, but this is still abuse and it shows that the feelings/thoughts that lead your step-father to abuse you in the first place still exist. The reason they pulled this stunt with the money is because its easy to justify that you're only mad about the money rather than the real underlying issue here. Your step-father clearly doesn't like you, respect you or see you as part of the family. It doesn't matter if he's broke and he cut you out $5 worth or $5 million dollars worth, his actions clearly say that he still feels the same way about you as he did when he abused you as a child. 

If your step-father feels like because he is the breadwinner in the family he gets to dictate where the money goes than thats bullshit, whatever role your mother played in the relationship doesn't matter, they're married and thats a 2-way street she has every right to demand that you guys get your share of the inheritance, especially considering they've been married for 35+ years. Honestly its already insulting that she doesn't get the full 100% of the money when he dies and then the 3 of you split whatever is left when both of them are gone. The fact that your half-brother gets 50% right off the top and no one seemed to even blink an eye at that seems like your step-fathers manipulation and control runs so deep in your family you're already conditioned to accept it. I have 4 children in my family and if my dad died and gave one of us half the money while my mom was still living.... idk what would happen but I know for a fact all of my siblings would be pissed and know that its wrong.

One thing that could change the scenario but I think you would of mentioned it as it's relevant, if your half-brother is incapable if taking care of himself due to a mental or physical disability and he needs your parents to support him than that could be why they left him the money. This doesn't sound like the case though.

I would consider giving them an ultimatum. If they want you and your family in their lifes before they die your step-father needs to straight up crucify himself over his actions twords you and your sister, and your real mother better bring some regret to the table herself. The fact that this shit is still going on this late in life for your family is ridiculous.

That’s so rude that you do that to him and I completely understand him being hurt.

You can’t have relax time when he’s there. Yeah I bet that makes him feel so welcome.


Edit: I’ve been talking to other users here and I’ve come to a conclusion.

I think you both need to sit down and talk openly and honestly about how each other is feeling.
I think his hurt has an underlying emotion to it which may be fear? A fear that you need this time away from him. A fear that he may not be good enough for you etc. he may be worried and that would cause him anxiety as well which would get worse in the long run.

I’m worried he may be getting depressed each time he has to leave because he doesn’t fully understand WHY you need this time.

I do still believe it’s harsh but I think if you both have a deeper understanding of each other then it’s better going forward. 
I think that my thinking it’s rude is because he doesn’t have a full understanding of what is going on inside your head.  We don’t know what’s going on until it’s spelled out.

My mom got out of the way early on and just let the chips fall. My personal opinion is that it's better that she did- I don't think this is a pain that kids in this situation can be protected from. I think they have to see for themselves when their absentee parent isn't invested. Otherwise it will always just be your fault.

I suggest that you push back a tiny bit. Not everything is an OMG must attend. Some work stuff is 100% must attend. Some is 0-10%. Your wife is a grown up and can tell the difference between them.

The most important thing is that time with the kids is a priority, which is an important part of family life and will become more important as your kids grow up. If you want to view this in terms of negative reinforcement, even young kids can tell which parent is really there for them and which parent isn't. Is she going to be heartbroken when the kids run to you with every scrape, every frog, every story from school, every failure and every triumph?

As a woman, I would run a mile from someone like this. The idea of being punished all day and then being told to sleep on the sofa like a bad dog is just... revolting.

HOWEVER. For anyone genuinely wondering why putting something in the dryer would be a big deal: I once had someone put a whole load of laundry into the dryer on high heat. That load was washed on delicate/cold, and was to be hung up - all super delicate materials or stitching that if dried in the machine would bunch up and become unwearable. The dryer 100% destroyed the entire load, either shrinking it down to comical tiny size or having it disintegrate from the heat (like you'd pick it up and tear a hole in it). 

I was understandably upset, because I had repeatedly asked that nobody in the house touch my laundry due to previous accidents. I don't have a lot of clothes, and these were all my nicest/most expensive pieces for work. I had to throw them all out, and I was left with only a handful of work-appropriate things. The person who did this angrily said ""Well I was just trying to help, there's no need to get so upset."" 

I'm sure from their perspective, I was this ungrateful B who flipped out over nothing. In reality though, they cost me hundreds of dollars in clothes, which they had no intention of contributing towards the replacement of. If OP did something similar (i.e. for the 8th time threw everything in the dryer and ruined her clothes, and then acted like she was nuts for being upset) then I can imagine perhaps her wrath would be more understandable, and perhaps OP's account of what happened may be skewed.

He is allowed in her room with her and sit on the bed but not be under the covers. Honestly, that does not seem crazy unreasonable or overly strict to me.

When he visits, he needs to be picked up by a certain time, but sometimes those times vary. That doesn't seem that weird to me. Perhaps there is a difference based on whether or not it is a school night or not, whether or not the parents had plans that evening, whether or not the girl has chores or homework to finish. The times given (between 7:30 to 9:30 pm) seem reasonable to me considering that this is a new relationship.

The first thing a deli worker should do when asked to slice meat is cut a ‘test slice’ and make sure the size is exactly what the customer wants. That ‘test slice’ can be discarded (a lot of people don’t want the first cut slice) or it can be given as a sample. Then they should cut the meat, measuring every few slices to get as close to the target weight as possible. ‘Going a little over’ should only be about .1, maybe .2 of a pound maximum. A slice should never be ripped in half to get the right weight. When all of the meat is sliced, the employee should tell the customer the final weight, and verify that it’s acceptable before bagging and labeling it.

I’m not sure where this took place, but that employee clearly wasn’t trained correctly. That, or she didn’t care. You tried to communicate what she did wrong/that you weren’t happy with the final product, and she half-assed a ‘solution.’ You are under no obligation to purchase something you aren’t satisfied with.

I'll also agree with another commenter that the whole concept of microaggressions is very nuanced and personal, making it hard to navigate or generalize. 

The general principle, though, is that black people (or really anyone that isn't white) in the US have a long history of being treated as ""not the norm"" in their own country. This runs the gamut from literal slavery, to legal restrictions on their rights, to social conventions that excluded them, to small personal biases that lead to unfair results. So when you point out something inherent in being black for special commentary, even if it's said positively, it runs the risk of being just one more thing in the pile of things that give them the impression they are viewed as foreign in their own communities. This same idea doesn't really apply from a black person to a white person because, in general, white people are considered the default and aren't made to feel like an ""other"" in the US. It may be rude to grill you about your hair routine, and it's definitely rude to just touch it without asking, but it doesn't build upon a history of oppression. It's just rude.

Now in a just world, this wouldn't be an issue. We could all have a default assumption that we all belong here, and a curious question about something unfamiliar (like hair texture) would just be that.

inulin isn't technically it allergy, but rather causes hypoglycemia in normal people ; and I'm reactive hypoglycemic, meaning I have to eat approximately every 3 hours or so otherwise my blood sugar drops to dangerous levels.

 Sounds like she's having some level of post-partum depression in that she's hopeless and about something that doesn't seem real when you look at her. It's normal she won't want to seek help right away in the throes of that. It may recede as hormones settle down or it may not, but it seems like she's still in a bit of shock over the changes of having a baby including her changing role and self image. It's a big change of identity she may not have expected to be so thrown by.

You sound like you're caring for her in not just wanting her to service you and ignore her own needs. It could be she doesn't want to lose you and is pleasing you to keep life together as much as she can. 

I suggest that you take a deep breath and step back and look at the issue as larger than sex. Consider how her life and self image has changed. Understand her physical and mental trauma. Take a look at resources in post-partum to educate yourself about it and how to respond. There may be other fathers you can reach out to locally or online who have experience. You can also talk to a doctor to get advice, look for someone with experience in post-partum, including her doctor if she'll give you advice, which won't require any disclosure of private health information of your wife if the doctor cites that. 

In the meantime, just hold her and keep loving intimacy between you. Let her know you still love and are attracted to her, but don't need her to service you with sex if she's not ready. Keep up with the romance when you can, when the baby is napping or in the care of others. Keeping the emotional and non sexual intimacy will help her restore her self confidence and trust in the relationship, but understand it may take time and it may require her to have treatment.",366.0,AmItheAsshole,,1784.0

Sex has consequences. If you don’t want to have babies, take precautions *before* you impregnate your wife!

Wear condoms. Pull out. Get a vasectomy. These are all things you can do to reduce the risk of pregnancy. Getting snipped is a more permanent solution — make sure you don’t blow off the follow up appointments. You want to make sure your sperm count is zero before you can call it a done deal.

Now, you are the asshole for blaming your wife for something you are also complicit in. She didn’t get pregnant by herself! Having an abortion is a big deal and she has body autonomy. So if you don’t want to risk kids, take ownership of birth control methods at your disposal!

If you’re not happy with the relationship, you can leave. But regardless of how much you like it, you are a father and abandoning your kids makes you garbage.

\> I get a decent grade on my written speech but my voiced speech grade was bad but admittedly that was my bad, when I had to answer questions the teacher just kept asking irrelevant questions which I couldn’t answer 

What were the questions? Without knowing what they were, it's hard to say that she was asking irrelevant ones. 

\> International women’s day comes around, she does a whole lesson on it, tells us to pick our female role model in our life, feminist pupil says Hermione Granger, not Emma Watson but the character, teacher agrees. 

She's an intelligent character and a competent one; I can see how one could see her as a good role model. 

\> I then say my dog who was very old at the time and sickly but she kept powering through it, teacher says it was an unreasonable choice and disrespectful. 

Choosing an animal as a female role mode is indeed unreasonable and disrespectful. 

\> Next written assessment comes around and we had to study articles, both articles were about feminism and women’s rights, absolutely nothing reasonable to write about them, yet again feminist pupils seem to get good grades.

What was unreasonable about the articles? We don't have any details here at all. And if the other students were getting good grades it may be because they simply did a better work than you did.

\> Throughout lessons afterwards teacher singled me out, calling me something similar to a nazi, can’t remember, saying I have strong opinions, just generally nothing kind about me. 

What did she said exactly? What was the context? We don't know nothing at all here, aside from you saying that she was acting in bad faith. 

\> During all this females in my year start calling me sexist, racist, a pig, nazi, horrible person, telling me to delete socials etc. 

That's what other students are doing. Seems like you're looking for a scapegoat. 

\> I start by asking her if she knew it was international men’s day that day, she said she didn’t know

Perfectly reasonable answer. Teachers don't know everything. 

\> I say it’s important to know, she says she didn’t know, I say she should’ve done something, she just keeps repeating herself. 

What part of ""I didn't know"" did you failed to understand? You seems to have been deliberately combative here. 

\> She threatens to send me to isolation for disruption if I don’t be quiet so I go quiet and carry on with my work.

That's a reasonable reaction from her; she gave you a perfectly valid answer as to why she didn't do anything yet you continued to be disruptive. 

\> She makes me stay behind after lesson and talk to her, she tells me what I did was wrong and she says she would’ve done something if she knew about it but I know that’s total BS 

How do you *know*? You don't. You're assuming malice when really it's much more likely that she *didn't know about it*

\> head of English department walks in asking what happened, teacher shows me negatively, I have to say sorry to get no punishment. 

You didn't accept her explanation and kept arguing despite the fact she gave you a valid reason as to why she didn't plan anything. 

\> The head was quite clearly a SJW or a suck up if you looked at him, he seems quite privileged so probably the reason he thought I was the bad one. 

Yeah, *he's* the judgmental one. Come on man. And using SJW seriously? Really?

\> Non-school uniform comes around and the English teacher wears a “The future is FEMALE.” shirt so I avoid eye contact the whole lesson. 

Not looking at someone because of a shirt. Really mature reaction here.

\> I plan to buy “The future is MALE.” shirt for the next non-school uniform. 

You want to buy a shirt with the sole intention of pissing someone off. But CLEARLY the teacher is the problem....

\> After all this my science class gets a substitute for the rest of the term and the substitute is the other feminist teacher in our school who is quite high up in power and she seems to do similar things to my English teacher and tells me off for no reason at all and will keep shouting at me.

Another angle that I'm not seeing being discussed: OP's sister is being robbed too. If the parents were told she needs a caretaker, then she NEEDS a caretaker.

I wonder how lost he would be without that support system. OP's parents obviously don't care about their autistic daughter, if they did they wouldn't push her off on a teenage brother who obviously isn't capable of handling that responsibility, or use her to scam their family.

I just hope she will be OK. What are the parents going to do with her now that their free babysitter and money are gone?

It depends on the state what action CPS would take; but OP should absolutely be transparent with his partner and draw a line in the sand that if her behavior continues without change you will open a CPS case. Alcohol is legal but everyone knows you don’t drink during pregnancy. Oftentimes in cases like these, CPS will become aware of the situation, provide recommendations and follow up to see if the recommendations have been acted on.

In my experience (TX, where weed is illegal): OP calls, opens a case, a caseworker comes to your home for an interview, establishes that momma has been intoxicated during pregnancy, advises and provides resources, then follows up later and again after the birth with an open case. No one is arrested, no disaster ensues, nobody’s baby is taken away. Marijuana is not a substance that would cause custody to be taken from mom, particularly because it’s legal in your state. But if mom continues to use and disregards the advice of the caseworker, THAT is something that will support you in seeking primary custody. 

Sometimes involving CPS is helpful in drawing a hard line for unacceptable behavior and acts as a third party that is solely interested in the best interest of your child. They don’t care about your partner’s sleep issues. They don’t care about what happens to your relationship as long as the child is in a safe and supportive home, wherever that is. It sounds like it is absolutely time for this intervention, and if you choose not to call, you are complicit in the potential harm of your unborn child and YWBTA.

AITA For disliking it when my girlfriend dresses inappropriately in public? I'm talking booty shorts / dresses that show literal ass when she bends over, crop tops that show underboob, etc. We've had a rough relationship at first but now it's great, i really dislike it when my S/O wears very revealing clothing. I've talked to her about it countless times but she still refuses to listen, calls me an asshole whenever i express concerns. So am i entitled to my girlfriends private parts myself, or am i seen as an ""Abusive asshole"" that should let my girl cuck me out in public by showing them off to other people as well. 

&#x200B;

Really considering leaving her for this. She would 100% go on a rampage if i did anything equivalent (E.G. show off abs/wear sweatpants, i never do, i just use them as an example when i tell her to see things through my eyes and how she would like it if i did the exact same thing, and she immediately gets very upset).

This seems to be the dissenting opinion, but what you are doing is terrible parenting. You said it yourself ""She needs to be taught a lesson"". So teach her. Explain to her the dangers of tinder, the risks, and that it is not a good way for her to find dates. 

Instead, you're given her a draconian punishment. What does that teach her? It teaches her that her parents at not her allies, and that she should hide things better from you in the future. That is not a lesson you want to teach your daughter.

You also need to ask yourself exactly what you are punishing your daughter for. What is her crime? Is it using tinder specifically, or wanting to date in general? Because your daughter is 16. She is going to date and she is going to experiment. That is normal. You cannot and should not suppress that. So if you are punishing her for that, you are a major asshole and even an abusive parent.

Your daughter should not be using tinder to date. It's not a place for minors. But that is something born if ignorance, and requires education and a good heart-to-heart. It doesn't require punishment.",361.0,AmItheAsshole,,1115.0
